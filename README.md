Project Overview
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Student Performance Dataset using
Python in Google Colab. The objective is to analyze students' academic performance based on
study time and gender and visualize the results.

Dataset
File Name: student-mat.csv
Key Columns:- G1, G2, G3: Grades of three academic terms- studytime: Weekly study time- sex: Gender (Male/Female)

Steps Performed
1. Data Loading using Pandas
2. Data Exploration (.head(), .shape(), .dtypes, missing values check)
3. Data Cleaning (handling missing values and duplicates)
4. Data Analysis (average score, correlation, gender comparison)
5. Data Visualization (histogram, scatter plot, bar chart)

Tools & Libraries- Python- Pandas- Matplotlib- Google Colab

Conclusion
The analysis helps understand the relationship between study time, gender, and students' final
academic performance.
